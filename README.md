# Arduino-Sensor-Display-with-Custom-Icons
This Arduino project reads temperature from a DHT11 sensor and light level from an LDR. It displays custom 2x2 icons (thermometer and light bulb) on a 16x2 LCD screen and alternates between temperature and light data every 2 seconds. The implementation uses no external libraries beyond the standard DHT and LiquidCrystal.
